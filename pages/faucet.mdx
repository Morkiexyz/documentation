# Faucet

Welcome to our **Faucet** page, where you can receive free tokens to use on our platform. Our faucet is designed to distribute coins to users, supporting a variety of blockchain networks.

## Supported Chains

Currently, we support two chains, but stay tuned for more additions in the future:

- **BeraChain bArtio**
- **Mint Sepolia**

## How It Works
1. **Visit Website:** [Faucet](https://faucet.morkie.xyz).
2. **Select a Chain:** Choose the blockchain network you wish to receive tokens on.
3. **Enter Your Wallet Address:** Provide your wallet address associated with the selected chain.
4. **Claim Your Tokens:** Click on the "Claim" button to receive your free tokens.

Please note that there is a cooldown period between claims to ensure fair distribution to all users.

## Future Plans

We are continuously working to add more chains and improve the faucet experience. Keep an eye on this page for future updates.
